A random generator tool using API quotes.

What's the functionality?

- It picks a random quote from the array, 
- It's searching for the author and shows it under the quote,
- It's checking the lenght of the text and changes the styling to fit in the container,
- It has the capability to tweet the quote.

You can change the apiUrl or you can use the local file with a little change on the 'getQuote' function.
You need to provide the path of the file for the 'apiUrl' constant and keep the same structure for the quotes jason file.

Hope you enjoyed! :D
